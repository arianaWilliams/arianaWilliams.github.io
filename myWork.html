              On May 24th we were given the opportunity to create a project in
              small groups, utilizing the programming concepts we have learned
              thus far.<br />
              Our goal was to maintain a balance of maximizing the outer bounds
              of our capabilities, without compromising our timeline.<br />
              After discussing potential options, we agreed that ALM Blackout
              Bingo would achieve this goal.<br />
              This challenging project would allow us to demonstrate the current
              skills we have acquired through TLG, in the allotted time frame,
              given we push ourselves.<br />This group project will serve as a
              milestone for our growth achieved as developers.

              We wanted to create a store-like webpage that challenged us to use different API’s than what was presented in class. ​<br/>
              We pushed ourselves to produce a store that offered a service rather than a tangible, physical products.

              We were requested to make a simple RPG game.<br />
              Our goal was to create a game that implemented moving from room to room. viewing a map and interacting with NPC's. In addition, we created a look, get, and drop function.<br />

          As a novice developer embarking on the path of crafting innovative solutions, my fellow team members and I encountered an array of challenges across several projects. These experiences have left us with invaluable lessons that have honed my skills as adaptive problem-solvers.
          <br />
          <br />
          Among the most impactful challenges we encountered was tight time constraints. In the midst of project deadlines, we often found ourselves racing against the clock, where every moment was crucial. Consequently, we frequently had to make thoughtful design choices that fit within our limited time frame. This process taught us a crucial lesson – that the world beyond our project scope is influenced by timelines and budgetary constraints, which significantly shape the course of product development. This challenge wasn't just a hurdle to overcome; it provided us a glimpse into the real-world dynamics where efficiency and creative resourcefulness are prized assets.
          <br />
          <br />
          In addition to time pressure, we grappled with the complex landscape of diverse development tools. As budding developers brimming with innovative ideas, we navigated through unfamiliar territories where our conceptual brilliance often outpaced our technical know-how. Transforming our visions into tangible solutions felt like piecing together a puzzle. We quickly realized that our collective strength was a wellspring of resilience. By leveraging each other's expertise, we harnessed the power of collaboration to overcome intricate technical obstacles. This journey illuminated a vital truth – seeking guidance and insights externally is not a sign of weakness, but a testament to our commitment to achieving optimal results.
          <br />
          <br />
          While these challenges demanded much from us, they were instrumental in our transformation. They instilled in me the ability to gracefully navigate time-sensitive complexities, find a balance between ambition and practicality, and maintain a relentless drive to learn, adapt, and conquer the unknown. Our experiences have forged a sturdy skill set that thrives under pressure, celebrates innovation, and thrives on unwavering teamwork.
          <br />
          <br />
          As I reflect on our endeavors, I am not just recounting obstacles surmounted; I am revealing a tapestry interwoven with the threads of collaboration, ingenuity, and persistence – that bears witness to my resolute commitment to overcoming challenges and shaping a future fueled by innovation and purpose.
